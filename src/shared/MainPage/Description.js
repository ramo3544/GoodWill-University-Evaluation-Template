                    Welcome to the GWU Course Evaluation! 
                    This evaluation is a means for students to provide 
                    feedback about the course, instructor, and management team. 
                    The MISSION.code team will use this feedback to assess 
                    the quality of instruction for continuous improvement purposes. 
                    We would appreciate your candid feedback in order to improve this course for future iterations.
